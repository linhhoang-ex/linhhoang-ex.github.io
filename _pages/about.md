Currently, I am working as a data scientist at Rakuten Group, Inc.
Before that, I graduated from [The University of Aizu](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/en/) with a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering in 2024.
During my PhD, I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Anh Pham](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~pham/) at the [Computer Communications Laboratory (CCL)](http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/ce-cc/).

My doctoral research entitled _“AI-empowered Control and Management of UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks”_ investigated a new approach that integrates machine learning techniques (deep learning and reinforcement learning) into the resource management and deployment of UAV-aided communication networks.
The two focuses were optimizing network resource allocation and adaptive deployment of aerial base stations to enable mobile edge computing and internet from space in next-generation networks (5G and Beyond).

<!-- My interests include statistics, data analysis, and data-driven forecasting. I am passionate and curious about finding insights from large-scale data and developing data-driven solutions to business problems.  -->
